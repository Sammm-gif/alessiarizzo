          I was born in Northern Italy in 1999.<br />
          In 2019 I enrolled at the School of Fine Arts "Accademia Albertina" in
          Turin. <br />
          Here, I perfected my technical skills and I came in touch with
          different forms of art. While I had always been painting it was a
          turning point for me since it allowed to experiment and enlarge my
          artistic capabilities.<br />
          I also had the opportunity to meet amazing artists and to even join
          the "Collettivo Mostro" which allowed me to play in a different
          regimen, without fixed hierarchies and institutional obligations.<br />
          This forced me to experiment with collective work which taught me to
          create strategies and synergies and share spaces with other
          artists.<br />
          My favourite form of art is definitely painting which has always been
          a huge part of my persona, but expanding my style was a priority of
          mine during university years so I started employing different
          materials and techniques, in order to give my works more substance and
          three-dimensionality.<br />
          What I feel the urge to express and share through my paintings are the
          nature and the psyche of human being. I am interested in the
          relationship between body and space, which is interpreted as the
          structure of existence. <br />What I usually do is rearranging
          elements such as people and things that are observed from my point of
          view. I take photos and then I expand on those with my art.

                Alessia Rizzo was born on 15/01/1999 in Novi Ligure (Italy). She studied at the Art School, focusing on ﬁgurative art.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019 she enrolled in the painting course at the Accademia Albertina in Turin (School of Fine Arts), where she completed the three-year course in 2023. Also in 2023, she joined the group Collettivo Mostro and began to experiment with a diﬀerent reality of artistic exchange, without hierarchies and outside institutional circles. Since joining the group, she has experimented with collective work, emphasising horizontal creative processes, and the sharing of spaces with other artists, eventually opening them up to the public in 'open studio' events.

            <p>
                She privileges the language of painting, whose experimentation is interwoven with other techniques and materials. Hand-cut and hand-stitched details from salvaged canvases, the use of charcoal and photographic elements enrich the canvases, giving them additional substance and three-dimensionality. research focuses on human beings and their nature, and she is interested in exploring the relationship between body and space, seen as the structure of existence, through compositions that incorporate subjects and objects taken from personal photographs of ephemeral and ﬂeeting moments, which are later rearranged on the canvas. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                She has recently returned as an artist to the places of her origin, the Ovada region. Here she has established her painting practice, with the construction of a studio and collaboration with local realities.</p>
