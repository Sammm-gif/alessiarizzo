                Alessia Rizzo was born on 15/01/1999 in Novi Ligure (Italy). She studied at the Art School, focusing on ﬁgurative art.

                In 2019 she enrolled in the painting course at the Accademia Albertina in Turin (School of Fine Arts), where she completed the three-year course in 2023. Also in 2023, she joined the group Collettivo Mostro and began to experiment with a diﬀerent reality of artistic exchange, without hierarchies and outside institutional circles. Since joining the group, she has experimented with collective work, emphasising horizontal creative processes, and the sharing of spaces with other artists, eventually opening them up to the public in 'open studio' events.

                She privileges the language of painting, whose experimentation is interwoven with other techniques and materials. Hand-cut and hand-stitched details from salvaged canvases, the use of charcoal and photographic elements enrich the canvases, giving them additional substance and three-dimensionality. research focuses on human beings and their nature, and she is interested in exploring the relationship between body and space, seen as the structure of existence, through compositions that incorporate subjects and objects taken from personal photographs of ephemeral and ﬂeeting moments, which are later rearranged on the canvas.

                She has recently returned as an artist to the places of her origin, the Ovada region. Here she has established her painting practice, with the construction of a studio and collaboration with local realities.</p>
